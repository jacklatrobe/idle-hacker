# IDLE HACKER DEV DIARY

## 07/01/2023 - jack@latrobe.group
I got bored one night and decided to try and write an idle game. I downloaded a simple temple off the W3 website, asked ChatGPT how to get started, and pulled together and initial prototype of IDLE HACKER.
Still lots more to do. Need to move some of the generation of new HTML blocks into the javascript instead so that I can dynamically create new lines for new jobs, skills etc.... I think? Is that even the right way to do that? I have a feeling there must be some kind of better way that uses templates or something, but for now it'll do, so I'll do it, but fully expect this decision to bite me in the ass later... so thats why I have started this diary.

EDIT: Ride the dragon sooooonnn - started this thing at 2am, now at 2pm next day I have a working base prototype with a bonus logging framework!
